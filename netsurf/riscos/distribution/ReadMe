Installation
------------

Installation is a three step process:

   1.  Use the Boot Merge facility provided by Configure to merge
       the supplied !Boot directory with the one on your system.

       If there is no !Boot merge facility on your system, simply
       drag the supplied !Boot over your existing boot structure.

   2.  Use the System Merge facility provided by Configure to merge
       the supplied !System directory with the one on your system.

   3.  Drag the !NetSurf application directory to a place on your
       hard disc.

Double click on !NetSurf in your chosen location to launch NetSurf.


Note   NetSurf requires WindowManager 3.80 or later. This comes
       with RISC OS 4 and above. RISC OS 3 users should install
       the Universal Boot Sequence from:
