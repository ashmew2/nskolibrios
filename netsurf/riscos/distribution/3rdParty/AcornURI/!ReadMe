AcornURI 1.04
-------------

Hi. This is a complete reimplementation of Acorn's URI module such that it
works on Iyonix. This allows simple URI / URL launching from applications. 
Merge this !System with your own, then (re)launch your favourite browser to
ensure it's running.

This has a few advantages over the official offering: it's smaller,
compatible with more browsers and more tolerant of errors.

This is released under the terms of the LGPL, which is included in this
archive as the file Copying. Previous versions of this module were released
under the GPL, and are still available from sudden.recoil.org.

Source is available from the same place you downloaded this archive, ie
<http://sudden.recoil.org/others/acornuri/acornuri104src.zip>


Changelog
---------

v1.04 20-May-06		Relicensed under the LGPL (rather than GPL)
