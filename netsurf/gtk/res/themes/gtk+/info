for local theming, the folder may be placed directly [as a subfolder] into the netsurf/gtk/res/themes folder; then 'add theme' from the preferences->advanced tab;

for downloadable themes, compile netsurf/utils/container.c according to the instructions in the header of that file; make a netsurf container of the folder, serve it as content-type "application/x-netsurf-theme"; browse to it in NetSurf, then NetSurf should automatically install it
