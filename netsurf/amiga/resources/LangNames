# LangNames file for NetSurf AmigaOS
# 
# Maps AmigaOS locale.library language names to the two character
# ISO-639 codes, enabling localised text strings files shareable
# with the RISC OS version of NetSurf, without the hassle of
# renaming directories, and to specify accept-language encoding
# with no additional configuration.
#
# Format is <Locale language name>:<language tag>
#
# NetSurf will use the full AmigaOS language name if it is not
# present in this file.
