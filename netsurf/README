Welcome to the Official KolibriOS port for Netsurf!
---------------------------------------------------

This is a work under progress.

If you have an executable, you can skip to the "Running the binary on KolibriOS" section below.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to compile this, you need to first build all libraries using the maker.sh script on your machine.
Once that is done, You need to build netsurf with the builder.sh script.

PREREQUISITES FOR COMPILING
---------------------------
kos32-gcc Compiler is set up at /home/autobuild/tools/win32/bin/kos32-gcc

Set up your path to contain /home/autobuild/tools/win32/bin/

Kolibrios SVN sources are at $HOME/kolibrios

maker.sh is the build script for Building Netsurf required libraries.

zlib has been compiled from contrib/sdk/sources/zlib and the libz.a file placed at /home/autobuild/tools/win32/lib

libc.dll.a and libapp.a and libiberty.a have been compiled from $HOME/kolibrios/contrib/sdk/sources/newlib/libc and copied to /home/autobuild/tools/win32/lib

After that: Simply run builder.sh from this directory. It will compile your stuff.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running the binary on KolibriOS
===============================

Copy the executable nsbin into a directory.

Set up the kolibrios/ directory as this is required for running libc applications like Netsurf.

You also need boxlib and http obj libraries at least (These are part of standard installation, so I don't think it needs any setup).

CleverMouse said "You have probably not configured the folder /kolibrios. In order to do 
this, copy the folder /kolibrios and the file kolibri.lbl from the 
distribution kit to the root of some partition accessible from 
KolibriOS, so that /hdX/Y/kolibri.lbl and /hdX/Y/kolibrios/, or 
/usbhdX/Y/kolibri.lbl and /usbhdX/Y/kolibrios/ are accessible from 
KolibriOS. And yes, this is a sacred knowledge not present in the 
documentation." - http://board.kolibrios.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=2865&p=58495&hilit=.lbl#p58495


Once you have set up these directories, you can execute KolibriOS and 
run the nsbin executable.

I usually use this as the command to run my qemu instance of Kolibri:

qemu-system-x86_64 -L . -m 128 -fda ~/Downloads/kolibri.img -boot a -localtime -vga vmware -net nic,model=rtl8139 -net user -soundhw ac97 -usb -usbdevice disk:format=raw:fat:/home/bob/dev-netsurf/workspace/netsurf/ -usbdevice tablet -usbdevice disk:format=raw:fat:/home/bob/kosmount/ &

ISSUES
====


[s] Handle Headers , especially cookies to handle maintaining sessions. Right now it'll just keep kicking you out if you try to log onto a site.[/s]

[s] Colours are messed up right now, somehow the RED component is missing. Probably something wrong in the pixel layout in memory.[/s]

[s] Properly handle all return codes. We just abort fetch if http code is not 200 or 3xx.[/s]

[s] Crash with imgur.com[/s]

[s] Remove hard coded paths about /usbhd0/1/ so that the binary can run from anywhere.[/s]
[s]	    We just need to place res/ in the same directory as netsurf executable now.[/s]
	    
[s]No image support yet.[/s]
[S]No JPEG Support.[/S]
[S]No GIF Support.[/S]

[s]Entry boxes do not load.[/s]
[s]board.kolibrios.org crashes after some time.[/s]

[s]No POST yet. Only GET.[/s]

[s]free() crashes for favicon string in url_unescape() function. It is disabled for now, but we need it sooner or later.[/s]
[s]Port libiconv [/s]

[s]Fix crash related to loading wiki.osdev.org (and other websites with PNGs)[/s]

[s]Add support for multipart/form-data POST requests.[/s]

===================================================================================================

Upload libiconv port to SVN. Make size smaller. Strip useless crap from the big source code before it.

Stop feeding HTTP Header line to core.

Add custom pages for 404 or 5xx errors like what "regular browsers" show. Designers! *Looks at Leency*

Fix pixel-to-colour alpha blending in plotter for 32xbgr. 

No HTTPS (Half of the world uses it....Damn PolarSSL..)

Handle TAB key to cycle through fields.
Handle arrow keys to move in the title bar.

Polish and Finish kolibri surface for libnsfb.

Merge to CI of Netsurf.

There are too many debug statements around the code (including libs), remove them.

Downloads probably won't work right now [ Untested, but best guessed ]

Slow Page loading times.

CSS Does not always load pretty graphics for the same website (For example board.kolibrios.org).

Handle netsurf command line handling arguments

No FileSystem caching yet. Need to enable FS Backing Store.
Caching is disabled , especially If-modified-since and if-none-match headers.
The caching can be enabled later when everything else is Working 100%.

Might crash randomly because of some malloc/free issues after an HTTP POST.

No Javascript.
