Welcome to the Official KolibriOS port for Netsurf!
---------------------------------------------------

This is a work under progress.

If you have an executable, you can skip to the "Running the binary on KolibriOS" section below.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to compile this, you need to first build all libraries using the maker.sh script on your machine.
Once that is done, You need to build netsurf with the builder.sh script.

PREREQUISITES FOR COMPILING
---------------------------
kos32-gcc Compiler is set up at /home/autobuild/tools/win32/bin/kos32-gcc

Set up your path to contain /home/autobuild/tools/win32/bin/

Kolibrios SVN sources are at $HOME/kolibrios

maker.sh is the build script for Building Netsurf required libraries.

zlib has been compiled from contrib/sdk/sources/zlib and the libz.a file placed at /home/autobuild/tools/win32/lib

libc.dll.a and libapp.a and libiberty.a have been compiled from $HOME/kolibrios/contrib/sdk/sources/newlib/libc and copied to /home/autobuild/tools/win32/lib

After that: Simply run builder.sh from this directory. It will compile your stuff.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running the binary on KolibriOS
===============================

Copy the executable nsbin into a directory.

Set up the kolibrios/ directory as this is required for running libc applications like Netsurf.

You also need boxlib and http obj libraries at least (These are part of standard installation, so I don't think it needs any setup).

CleverMouse said "You have probably not configured the folder /kolibrios. In order to do 
this, copy the folder /kolibrios and the file kolibri.lbl from the 
distribution kit to the root of some partition accessible from 
KolibriOS, so that /hdX/Y/kolibri.lbl and /hdX/Y/kolibrios/, or 
/usbhdX/Y/kolibri.lbl and /usbhdX/Y/kolibrios/ are accessible from 
KolibriOS. And yes, this is a sacred knowledge not present in the 
documentation." - http://board.kolibrios.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=2865&p=58495&hilit=.lbl#p58495


Once you have set up these directories, you can execute KolibriOS and 
run the nsbin executable.

I usually use this as the command to run my qemu instance of Kolibri:

qemu-system-x86_64 -L . -m 128 -fda ~/Downloads/kolibri.img -boot a -localtime -vga vmware -net nic,model=rtl8139 -net user -soundhw ac97 -usb -usbdevice disk:format=raw:fat:/home/bob/dev-netsurf/workspace/netsurf/ -usbdevice tablet -usbdevice disk:format=raw:fat:/home/bob/kosmount/ &

====
ISSUES
====

Slow Page loading times.
We first download all data and then inform the core. This should be done as the chunks are received to help overall latency.
My priority is stability first then speed. Once I feel the HTTP and CSS loading and status code handling is stable, I will try to look into this. Not a priority at the moment IMHO.

===FIXED=== Handle Headers , especially cookies to handle maintaining sessions. Right now it'll just keep kicking you out if you try to log onto a site.

===FIXED=== Colours are messed up right now, somehow the RED component is missing. Probably something wrong in the pixel layout in memory.

CSS Does not always load pretty graphics for the same website (For example board.kolibrios.org).

===FIXED=== Properly handle all return codes. We just abort fetch if http code is not 200 or 3xx.

===FIXED=== Crash with imgur.com

Handle netsurf command line handling arguments

Remove hard coded paths about /usbhd0/1/ so that the binary can run from anywhere.

No HTTPS (Half of the world uses it....Damn PolarSSL..)

Handle TAB key to cycle through fields.

Polish and Finish kolibri surface for libnsfb.

No image support yet.

No Javascript.

===FIXED=== Entry boxes do not load.
===FIXED=== board.kolibrios.org crashes after some time.
===FIXED=== Might crash for some sites (Especially for 404s). This seems to be fixed now. A crash now would be useful.

===FIXED=== No POST yet. Only GET.

No FileSystem caching yet. Need to enable FS Backing Store.
The caching can be enabled later when everything else is Working 100%.

free() crashes for favicon string in url_unescape() function.
       It is disabled for now, but we need it sooner or later.

There are too many debug statements around the code (including libs), remove them.

Downloads probably won't work right now [ Untested, but best guessed ]

==FIXED== Port libiconv 

Upload libiconv port to SVN. Make size smaller. Strip useless crap from the big source code before it.

Stop feeding HTTP Header line to core.

===FIXED=== Fix crash related to loading wiki.osdev.org (and other websites with PNGs)

Merge to CI of Netsurf.

Add support for multipart/form-data POST requests.

Add custom pages for 404 or 5xx errors like what "regular browsers" show. Designers! *Looks at Leency*
