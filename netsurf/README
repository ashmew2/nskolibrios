Welcome to the Official KolibriOS port for Netsurf!
---------------------------------------------------

This is a work under progress.

If you have an executable, you can skip to the "Running the binary on KolibriOS" section below.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You need multiple libraries for compiling netsurf successfully.
Read the next section for more information or check github.com/ashmew2/nskolibrios.

PREREQUISITES FOR COMPILING
---------------------------
kos32-gcc Compiler is set up at /home/autobuild/tools/win32/bin/kos32-gcc
Set up your path to contain /home/autobuild/tools/win32/bin/
Kolibrios SVN sources are at $HOME/kolibrios

Required libraries:

libpng
libjpeg
zlib
libapp
libc
libiberty
Other libraries (Check repository for all of them).

Libraries should be compiled to .a files and placed at /home/autobuild/tools/win32/lib OR inst directory
(Check the Makefile.target inside kolibrios directory)

After all libraries are set up, you can execute :

make TARGET=kolibrios

nskolibrios is your executable.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Running the binary on KolibriOS
===============================

Set up the kolibrios/ directory as this is required for running libc applications like Netsurf.

You also need boxlib and http obj libraries at least (No additional setup required..)

CleverMouse said "You have probably not configured the folder /kolibrios. In order to do 
this, copy the folder /kolibrios and the file kolibri.lbl from the 
distribution kit to the root of some partition accessible from 
KolibriOS, so that /hdX/Y/kolibri.lbl and /hdX/Y/kolibrios/, or 
/usbhdX/Y/kolibri.lbl and /usbhdX/Y/kolibrios/ are accessible from 
KolibriOS. And yes, this is a sacred knowledge not present in the 
documentation." - http://board.kolibrios.org/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=2865&p=58495&hilit=.lbl#p58495

Extract the _netsurf.zip file into a directory that KolibriOS will use.
Make sure nskolibrios (executable) and res/ directory are in the same location.
Execute nskolibrios executable.

I usually use this as the command to run my qemu instance of Kolibri:

qemu-system-x86_64 -L . -m 128 -fda ~/Downloads/kolibri.img -boot a -localtime -vga vmware -net nic,model=rtl8139 -net user -soundhw ac97 -usb -usbdevice disk:format=raw:fat:/home/bob/dev-netsurf/workspace/netsurf/ -usbdevice tablet -usbdevice disk:format=raw:fat:/home/bob/kosmount/ &

ISSUES
====


[s] Handle Headers , especially cookies to handle maintaining sessions. Right now it'll just keep kicking you out if you try to log onto a site.[/s]

[s] Colours are messed up right now, somehow the RED component is missing. Probably something wrong in the pixel layout in memory.[/s]

[s] Properly handle all return codes. We just abort fetch if http code is not 200 or 3xx.[/s]

[s] Crash with imgur.com[/s]

[s] Remove hard coded paths about /usbhd0/1/ so that the binary can run from anywhere.[/s]
[s]	    We just need to place res/ in the same directory as netsurf executable now.[/s]
	    
[s]No image support yet.[/s]
[S]No JPEG Support.[/S]
[S]No GIF Support.[/S]

[s]Entry boxes do not load.[/s]
[s]board.kolibrios.org crashes after some time.[/s]

[s]No POST yet. Only GET.[/s]

[s]free() crashes for favicon string in url_unescape() function. It is disabled for now, but we need it sooner or later.[/s]
[s]Port libiconv [/s]

[s]Fix crash related to loading wiki.osdev.org (and other websites with PNGs)[/s]

[s]Add support for multipart/form-data POST requests.[/s]
[s]Polish and Finish kolibri surface for libnsfb.[/s]

===================================================================================================

Upload libiconv port to SVN. Make size smaller. Strip useless crap from the big source code before it.

Stop feeding HTTP Header line to core.

Add custom pages for 404 or 5xx errors like what "regular browsers" show. Designers! *Looks at Leency*

Fix pixel-to-colour alpha blending in plotter for 32xbgr. 

No HTTPS (Half of the world uses it....Damn PolarSSL..)

Handle TAB key to cycle through fields.
Handle arrow keys to move in the title bar.

Merge to CI of Netsurf.

There are too many debug statements around the code (including libs), remove them.

Downloads probably won't work right now [ Untested, but best guessed ]

Merge libnsfb surface to Netsurf official repo.

Slow Page loading times.

CSS Does not always load pretty graphics for the same website (For example board.kolibrios.org).

Handle netsurf command line handling arguments

No FileSystem caching yet. Need to enable FS Backing Store.
Caching is disabled , especially If-modified-since and if-none-match headers.
The caching can be enabled later when everything else is Working 100%.

Might crash randomly because of some malloc/free issues after an HTTP POST.

No Javascript.
