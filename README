Welcome to the KolibriOS port for Netsurf!

This is a work under progress.

In order to compile this, you need to first build all libraries using the maker.sh script on your machine.
Once that is done, You need to build netsurf with

--------------------------------------------
Set up the C cross compiler (Mingw32 based) first.

This requires you to place the cross compiler into /home/autobuild/
--------------------------------------------

PREREQUISITES for the make step are:

Compiler is set up at /home/autobuild/tools/win32/bin/kos32-gcc
Kolibrios SVN sources are at $HOME/kolibrios
maker.sh is the build script for Building Netsurf required libraries.
zlib has been compiled from contrib/sdk/sources/zlib and the libz.a file placed at /home/autobuild/tools/win32/lib

After that: Simply run builder.sh from this directory. It will compile your stuff.
--------------------------------------------

This is the longer version (You dont need it with builder.sh):

$ make TARGET=kolibrios

After this step is done, you will many linker errors. But that is just because our compiler cannot handle that correctly yet.
So now, you need to

cd build-i686-linux/
kos32-ld -L/home/autobuild/tools/win32/mingw32/lib *.o ~/ofiles/*.o -lz -lc -lapp -lgcc -o netsurf

#This should get you a netsurf executable.

  Building NetSurf
==================
  
  Read the QUICK-START document in the Docs/ directory for instructions.


  Creating a new port
=====================

  Look at the existing front ends for example implementations.  The framebuffer
  front end is simplest and most self-contained.  Also, you can contact the
  developers for help:

  Further documentation
=======================

  The Developer section of the web site has loads of info to get you started:
