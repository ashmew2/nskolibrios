libutf8proc
===========

This is the Public software group utf8proc library [1] repackaged as a
conveniance library for NetSurf. Previously this library was simply
copied into the NetSurf sources.

This takes the unicode 5 capable version 1.1.6 of the library and
converts it to the NetSurf build system. additional API has been added
with a normalisation function but there are no data changes from
upstream.

All the Makefiles and changes are licenced as per the utf8proc
source using the MIT "expat" licence.
